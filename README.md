# PythonProgram
An unpacker for position data exported by the Unreal Engine project for Spatial Development made for University of Magna Grecia, Italy. The program builds animation data and a heatmap of where people have walked as data for later review.
This program in particular is very heavy on RAM because it collects all the data at once and converts it to a gif file. A future version might contain an iterative process to creater various .png files to then put them together into a .gif animation file.
